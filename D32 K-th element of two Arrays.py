'''
Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] and an element k, the task is to find the element that would be at the kth position of the combined sorted array.

Examples :

Input: a[] = [2, 3, 6, 7, 9], b[] = [1, 4, 8, 10], k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: The final combined sorted array would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The 5th element of this array is 6.
'''

class Solution:

    def kthElement(self, a, b, k):
        a.extend(b[:])
        a.sort()
        return a[k-1]
